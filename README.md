# HelpdeskCase1
Case Study for Client / Server. Goes through all 3 layers from Database to Website. Uses jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and C#

This was the first Case Study for INFO3070 Client / Server Application Development. Connects to HelpdeskDB through the DAL,
then through the ViewModels, then through the Controllers that interact with the website. Uses optimistic concurrency to
ensure data integrity when another user updates the information.

NOTICE: Contains some HTML quirks, such as headers that were not changed to display correct infomration, and a modal that
does not automaticaly close. However, the program works fluidly and ensures data integrity.
